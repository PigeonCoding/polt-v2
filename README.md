# polt-V2

this is just a project i made to learn react and a nodejs in general
it's not perfect but it works

## how to use

**important** this project currently only supports .mp4 videos

create a `content` folder in the `backend` directory
put all your videos in folders with names matching the content

example:
**backend>directory>(name of th serie/anime)>(episodes i recommand naming the episodes with their number)**

first run:
`npm install`

then run: 
```
cd ./backend
node server.js
```

or alternativly run the `polt-V2.bat/polt-V2.sh` file in the main directory
